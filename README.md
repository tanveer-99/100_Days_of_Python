### 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

I have started the `100 days of code` course by Angela Yu on Udemy.
I've found so much positive reviews of this course in google and youtube, so I chose this course to learn python.

Also, this course touches some major fields in technology where python is used, such as Web, Data analytics, Machine learning, etc.

I would try to upload the codes of most of the major projects done in the modules of the course and give a description of what each project does in each directory.

I hope I can finish the course completely.
